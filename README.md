# Graph Algorithms Visualizer

## Description
Graph Algorithms Visualizer is a tool to visualize various graph algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra’s Algorithm, and Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim’s Algorithm). This software provides a graphical representation of these algorithms and helps in understanding their working.

## Features
- **Add Node**: Add nodes to the graph.
- **Add Edge**: Add edges between nodes with specified weights.
- **DFS Visualization**: Visualize Depth-First Search algorithm.
- **BFS Visualization**: Visualize Breadth-First Search algorithm.
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm Visualization**: Visualize Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm.
- **Prim’s MST Visualization**: Visualize Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm.
- **Clear Graph**: Reset the graph.

## Installation
To run the Graph Algorithms Visualizer locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nrkkR/graph-algorithms-visualizer.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd graph-algorithms-visualizer
    ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser**
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```
    or simply double-click `index.html`.

## Usage
Upon opening the application, you will be greeted with the main interface where you can:

1. **Add Node**: Click the "Add Node" button and then click on the graph container to place a node.
2. **Add Edge**: Click the "Add Edge" button, then click on two nodes to create an edge between them. Enter the weight when prompted.
3. **Run Algorithms**: Click the buttons for DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, and Prim's MST to visualize these algorithms.
4. **Clear Graph**: Click the "Clear" button to reset the graph and start over.
